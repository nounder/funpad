# Ideas

## prompt_toolkit

it's more extensible than ipython and allows to build more
sophisticated interfaces rather than just a REPL

easy to integrate with asyncio

## bpython

it's not compatible with prompt_toolkit ecosystem but has great
built-in features like docstring previews

## render html output

auto refresh on change?

## use kitty icat for ipython prompt?

if function returns ipython.display.Image, print it
in terminal
